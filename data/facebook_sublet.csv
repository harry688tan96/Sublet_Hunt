I apologize if you have encountered any bugs or ugly UI/UX. Moreso, I am happy to announce that I have quit my job to work on this fulltime. Not just me, but 2 very talented friends of mine (Jimmy Zidan Guo & Vincent Chiang) have also quit their jobs and turned down offers from companies like Facebook. What we are working on is currently a secret, but we can say that it will make your life a whole lot easier. For now, please enjoy our growing library of 360' virtual tours (rentburrow.com/sage-5). We would also appreciate any suggestions or bug reports if you encounter them, just send me a fb message. Thanks for all your support Waterloo, see you soon!

*12-month lease only
*18-27 years old only

Best way to contact me is by text at 519 501 1572.

We are in a great location directly on many bus routes. The 201 is almost right outside the door and takes 12 mins to get to UW. The 12 and the 20 are both about a 10-minute walk away. The 12 goes up past both universities and down king street. The 20 goes straight to downtown Kitchener. It takes about 15-20 minutes to bike to either school which is a nice ride up University Ave. Anyone that has lived here agrees it is a great location. The house is also situated close to many restaurants and 3 grocery stores are within 5 minutes away.

My name is Andrew and I am a recently graduated student from UW. I have a 5 bedroom house which I'm looking to rent out one room for a 12-month lease starting on September 1st, 2017 and ending on August 31st, 2018. It is a very nice house with a ton of common space that has all been recently renovated. I own the house and I always have things fixed that break right away. We are also constantly improving and upgrading the house. The backyard, for instance, has been our current focus.

Currently, we have 4 rooms filled for the fall with myself (24), a 2nd year UW Math PhD (23), an IT Innovation and Design student at Conestoga (23) and a 3rd year Economics student (22) from WLU. We are 3 guys and a girl and we are great to get along with. Every once in a while we like to have a few friends over but nothing too crazy.

For 550/month you get:
-hydro
-water
-heat
-air conditioning
-laundry
-barbeque
-backyard patio
-raised firepit
-high-speed (25mbps) internet
-a shared netflix account
-Basic Bell Fibe TV package (open to splitting extra channels)

As you can see from the pictures, the bedroom in question is just down a few steps in a very large L-shaped room. The closet is quite sizable and should fit anything you need to store in there. There are two bathrooms shared between 5 bedrooms which we tend to keep very clean and tidy since there is nothing worse than a dirty bathroom. Our kitchen is also recently updated with stainless steel appliances, new cupboards and an open floor plan. We have all kinds of dishes, utensils, tools and small appliances you would ever need to cook with. We have also recently completed basement renovations adding another coach and big screen TV. I have provided couches, furniture, and tvs for the common areas. We are open to personalization if you want to bring some of your own common area furniture. The room is unfurnished but it can fit up to a king-sized bed if need be.

I don't think I've left anything out. If you have any questions don't be afraid to email, text or call. I will likely get back to you within a half hour and I won't bug you if you aren't interested. - Andrew Leest

Hey schoolyard chums. I currently have a music studio that I live in and teach from near Weber and Victoria Street. The bus ride is quick to the school. I am looking for someone to rent one of the rooms either this summer or starting in September. All utilities and internet is included. I am hoping to get a music student in and you are free to use my grand piano/instruments as long as you look after them. If I can get someone in who is interested in a teaching job, that would be awesome too. You will have to be okay with lessons going on (you'll be able to hear it in your room) during the afternoon and evening as this is my livelyhood and sometimes I have my dog there. I need someone who is clean and respectful of the studio space and if you want to party, this isn't the place. Contact me for more info.

$1 - Waterloo, Ontario

Hello all,
I am in need for a place I'll be willing to pay fairly but I am on a budget. (Please nothing more than $600/month) 
Hydro, heat, internet and all other utilities must be included. I need something clean and close to UW or UWL. If possible a two bedroom or 3 bedroom place I'll take all rooms. (If not possible I'm still interested) I'm also willing to be there for a full year but prefer a 4-8 month lease. I like apartments and townhouses but will take a house for a good price. I will also prefer to have my own bathroom. I have never missed rent from any of my previous landlord and sublets, I am clean and responsible and often not home. 
If anyone can meet these requirements please message me. 
Thanks guys!",2017-08-08T02:03:40+0000,sage,1.153,$1,2,"<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/110354088989367/permalink/1635075469850547"">link</a>"

I am in need for a place I'll be willing to pay fairly but I am on a budget. (Please nothing more than $600/month)

110354088989367_1655091881182239,"Review of kw4rent at 250 Lester st. PH01

I lived at this place for the past year and struggled to get help from kw4rent for their major ceiling leak problem.

When we were signing our contract we were shown a different unit with the same layout. This is usually fine, except when i walked in our unit, it had ceilings patched with pads (female hygiene product). I now assume that the previous tenant had the same problem and solved the problem with a temporary solution. Not knowing that there was a leaking problem, i removed all the pads from the ceiling. 

After that every time it rained, we had water leak in our bedrooms, kitchen, and the hallway. I've requested multiple help on the kw webpage, which had fast response but said technicians will come on a later date and that they can't really help. After multiple complains, they provided us with buckets to hold water. The maintenance manager once came and gave me his business card and told me to email him, but in the end he just told me it takes time to find source of the issue. In the beginning, i requested only for laundry compensations since the leak happened on my bed. Their promises on compensations were not followed up, and soon after the manager stopped replying to my ""its leaking again"" emails. 

I moved in mid September 2016, and the first leak report i handed in was October 16th 2016 (the pad was attached on the ceiling for a bit on the ceiling). The last leak in our unit, that I observed, happened July 2017. The third ticket on my maintenance request was marked complete August 5th 2017 (Third ticket because they always said it was complete and there was always leaks and I had to recreate tickets). 

Attached are some pictures of the leaked areas. I'm done with living with kw4rent and wanted to share my story to possible future kw4rent tenants.",2017-08-27T04:40:58+0000,250 lester st,0.7,,0,"<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/110354088989367/permalink/1655091881182239"">link</a>"

$500 - Ottawa

Hello! My apartment is at 2625 Regina street. It's an older condominium building. It has a gym, swimming pool, billiards room, and comes with a parking space that is available in the fall. It's within walking distance to two grocery stores and multiple food places. Lincoln fields bus station is about 10 min walk away, and all the major bus routes stop there. It's about a 20 minute bus ride to downtown. Also very close to bike trails, the river, and a beach. My place has two bathrooms, one is ensuite with the master bedroom which I am in, so we won't get in each other's way too much. Your room is furnished, and comes with a bed, desk, dresser, lamp, and closet.",2017-08-03T13:01:37+0000,2625 regina street,1.544,$500,0,"<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/142679255268/permalink/10155330172820269"">link</a>"

Hey, I'm Ines from Germany, 25 years old and I'm studying Business Administration. I'm from Germany and I'm very happy to go to WLU to do a semester abroad from september till december. As it is very hard to find a room from Germany I would be so happy to find a room before my arrival in Canada. So if you're subletting a room we could skype so I can show you that I'm a nice person 😊 I'm very organized and responsible so you can be sure that I will be very responsible with the stuff in the room. I would love to hear from you 😊",2017-07-04T07:28:07+0000, old,93.521,$700,0,"<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/142679255268/permalink/10155227289030269"">link</a>"
